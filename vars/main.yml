reboot: false

###
# update can either be:
#   false
#     Does nothing. Useful when used with check
#   everything
#     Self explanatory, essentially runs 'yum -y update'
#   security
#     DEFAULT
#     Only updates packages with security errata, as defined by yum-security.
#   cve
#     Given a list of CVEs via the 'cve' variable, will install any updates that meet these errata.
#     Your mileage may vary, don't see this used too much on CentOS.
